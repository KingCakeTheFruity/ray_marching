# RAY MARCHING
SDF appered to be such a powerful thing!

## How to use
Build project and run binary, that simple :)

Suggested IDE for building is VS. SFML lib must be linked to the project so it could be built correctly.

### Control
```
WASD, QE, SHIFT - moving
ZXC - scaling
F - screenshot
```

### Scene editing
Check out `scene_distance` function in the `shader.frag` file, it defines the scene
